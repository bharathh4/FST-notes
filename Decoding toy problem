Can you decode the following:

nMMMarkssmaaan
Maarzitiiaamnn

as Marsman and Martian respectively

Plan:
1. Write a input symbol list
2. Assumme that the following letters came in. More
   accurately a letter distribution comes in. 
   So we have a 14 postions and for each of those 
   postion we have a letters distribution.
   So we have a 26-length vector of probabilities of 
   each letter. A [26 x 14] matrix

3. Create a decoding graph that maps the letter sequence
 to a words. 

4. Searching the graph. 
     Iterate thru the letter distribution
     Create a token manger
     Load the Decoding FST graph
     Update your token manager using your letter distribution and the decoding graph
     Make sure your token manager doesn't get too big
