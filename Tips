fstconcate

If you are trying to fstconcat two FSTs, pay attention to start and end states. 
C.fst = fstconcate(A.fst, B.fst)
If A.fst has a last state that is not the start state then, the last state of A.fst gets hooked to first state of B.fst. 
If you want the first state of A.fst and B.fst to be the same in the concvatenated FST, then make sure A.fst and B.fst have closure
Likewise if you want an visual append like structure, then make sure A.fst and B.fst are not closed
